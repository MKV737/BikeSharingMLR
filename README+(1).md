# Project Name
Bike Sharing analysis

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
Problem Statement:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

Company wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

Business Goal:
	- Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
	- It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.

In this we have used 'day.csv'

## Observations
- One of the observation indicates a substantial year-over-year growth in ridership, highlighting the positive trend in user engagement with the service.
- During EDA analysis it was observed that the app was NOT used during 'Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog'.
- App is mostly used on weather conditions like '1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy' followed by '2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist'
- App is likely to be used during weather conditions like '3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds'
- Fall season has most ridership.
